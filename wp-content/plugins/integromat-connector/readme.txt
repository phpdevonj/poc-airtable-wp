== Installation ==

1. Upload the "integromat-connector" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. A new item called "Make" appears in the admin menu. Here you can see your API key, through which you can connect your WordPress site to Make.com. You can also select which custom fields you want to be visible in the REST API response.

This plugin allows you to safely connect your WordPress site to Make. It also gives you the possibility to work with custom meta fields (creating/updating them through the REST API and including them in the API response).

This plugin does not send any data to the make.com service itself. It only simplifies the connection process and allows custom fields to be included in the REST API responses.
